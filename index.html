            <p class="answer"><span>A:</span>I'm using only basic HTML and CSS files, since I do have already a project wiht plain html, css and javascript file uploaded or push using netlify, I think the challenge is storing it on github 1st and push it on netlify. Since I've create a new github account for this assessment, I'm getting errors on pushing the file from github, so track the errors and use resources for it to fixed.</p>

After, once you've notice there are so many links opened and it is overwhelming to see so many links on your browser</p>

              A customer writes in to Support saying simply that their “site won’t build”. You have access to their build logs, and there you see this error: Build failed due to a user error: Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2. You have no more information than this and the site’s source repository is private so you cannot test the build yourself. How would you troubleshoot this issue? What steps would you take? Also, please compose your best customer-facing first response.

            <p class="answer"><span>A:</span>I have tried to deploy function from my netlify app, I just have followed the documentaion. After I added the function that I have created, I see the functions directory look like disabled and I'm not sure if I did it correctly since there is no set Package directory and Publish directory also. After that I've tried to update commit from my github I getting errors on deploy logs seeing Failed to parse configuration tried to use the AI assistant tha is built in from netlify app check some documentaion I found out the the problem is from the build settings, because earlier I've configure it and add my repo to directory which is wrong. Because I thouht you'll need to reconfigure the build settings for your function to work. So I've change the configuration again and try to test and I see my function is working fine</p>

              We understand you don't know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you'd react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com. You can't immediately confirm the report, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven't confirmed their assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?

            <p class="answer"><span>A:</span>I may want to thank the reporter for bringing the attention to us, as we take this matter seriously. Then I will ask a breif desrcription about the issue he reported some relevant screenshot of the issue, logs and any other that he can provide to investigate it and easily escalate it if confirmed that is on security issue. Then I will test it my self, if getting unfamiliar errors or logs that's the time that I will notify the team about the issue</p>
